1. Hong Kong House Prices - HK is one of the place where houses prices are the MOST unaffordable.  When people argue it's supply and demand issue,
 some believes it's a monetary issue.  The more money flowing in the economy, the money needs to go somwhere.
Traditionally Asians favour properties investment over other investments.  Hence when M2 supply goes up, properties prices also go up.  The exception
is when there are major events like SARS, GFC..etc.  The following chart is created using PowerBI and illustrates this relationship.
